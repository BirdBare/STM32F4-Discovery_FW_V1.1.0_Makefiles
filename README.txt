STM32F4-Discovery FW v1.1.0 Makefiles
=======================================
	This project is intended to provide makefiles for use with 
STM32F4-Discovery FW v1.1.0  which can be downloaded from the ST website: 
http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/tools/PF257904#
	
	ST Micro provides projects for EWARM, MDK-ARM and TrueSTUDIO. However these 
are all commercial IDEs and possibly unaffordable for the home tinkerer. This
project was created to provide makefiles for each of the provided Projects.

	This is my first foray into Makefile programming. If you have any 
suggestions or comments please feel free to submit them to the issues list
